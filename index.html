        <h1>Working together for a better future</h1>

        <p class="p1">
        Guided by its kyosei philosophy that focuses on "living and working together for the common good", Canon is dedicated to producing innovative products and technologies to improve efficiency at home and in the office. We are committed to steering our research and manufacturing processes towards sustainability, providing a safe and healthy workplace, and delivering high quality products to our customers.

        <h2>Kyosei</h2>

        <p class="p2">
        The literal meaning of kyosei is "living and working together for the common good," but Canon's interpretation encompasses "All people, regardless of race, religion or culture, harmoniously living and working together into the future." In reality, our world has many imbalances in such areas as trade, income levels and the environment. Addressing these imbalances is an ongoing mission, and Canon is doing its part by actively pursuing kyosei. As a truly global company we foster good relationships not only with our customers, but also with communities in which we operate and the natural environment.

        <p class="p1">12 Jul 2022 — Canon today announced the launch of the RF24mm f/1.8 MACRO IS STM and RF15-30mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lenses, which are versatile and lightweight additions for photography enthusiasts using the EOS R range of mirrorless cameras.

        <br class="br 1">
        Both lenses take advantage of the large diameter and short back focus that the EOS R camera system is renowned for, which results in both a compact optical system and excellent quality throughout the whole image.
